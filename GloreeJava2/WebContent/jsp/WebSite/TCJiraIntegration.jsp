						<span class="normalText10">
						    Jira from Atlassian is a very popular issue tracking tool. Since it integrates well with other Atlassian products like Confluence and Service Desk, it has become
						    a very popular tool for software development.
						    
						    <br><br>
						    
						    Jira has another add in called Green Hopper which helps small agile teams manage tasks in short iteration. This combination may be the 
						    ideal solution for small teams focusing on Software Product Development.

							<span class="ttitle">If Jira is good, why do I need TraceCloud</span>
							<br><br>
							
							If you are dealing with a complex project, you process may need you to model and track the following...
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li> <b>Flexibility in Requirement Types</b> : You have to have custom Requirement Types </li>
								<li> <b>Flexibility in naming your Custom Attributes</b> : Different types of attribute to track specific values </li>
								<li> <b>Traceability</b> : Ability to link one type of Requirement to another and form a Traceability chain </li>
								<li> <b>Change Control</b> : Ensure that only authrorized groups can make the changes</li>
								<li> <b>Change Propagation</b> : Ensure that your change flows through your entire cycle of stakeholders (Business Analysts, Product Managers, Engineers, Testers, Release Managers)</li>
								<li> <b>Collaboration & Approval Work flow </b> : Help teams collaborate and have the right people sign off on changes</li>
								<li> <b>Dashboards and Release tracking</b> : Release and Project level tracking of customer requests</li>
								
							</ul>
							
							<br><br>
							This is where a TraceCloud <-> Jira integration makes a difference.
							
							<br><br>
							<span class="ttitle">Benefits</span>
