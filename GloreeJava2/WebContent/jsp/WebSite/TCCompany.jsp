						<span class="normalText10">
						    The year was 2008. <br><br>Shambhavi Roy and Sree Reddy  were frustrated. One was an Operations manager at Apple, and another was an Engineering manager at Cisco. 
							They were dealing with distributed teams, projects with too many moving parts, requirements that were constantly changing, bosses that 
							required regular updates, and clients that were clamoring for better prioritization. They looked around and saw tools that fell into 2 buckets.
							
							<br><br> There were Agile tools like Rally,
							Jira that were great at task tracking, but lacked traditional versioning, change control, change propagation and traceability 
							<br><br>
							or
							<br><br>There were traditional traceability tools like Requisite Pro and Doors that were great at change control, propagation and tracebility , but 
							suffered from lack of collaboration, easy reporting and ease of use.

							They had an epiphany <br><br> <div class="citation">	"There HAS to be a BETTER way to do this!!!" </div>

							<br><br>
							Shambhavi is a graduate of Indian Institute of Technology @ Kharagpur, and holds an MBA from UC Berkeley, Haas School of Business. Prior to TraceCloud, 
							she held management roles at Cisco and at Apple. Her philosophy is not to just <b><i>'Build a better mouse trap'</i></b>, but to <b></i>
							'Make the mouse trap, so simple and intuitive
							that the  mice will beat a path to it'</i></b> . Her job is to keep the TraceCloud system <b><i>Clean, Simple and Intuitive</i></b>.
							
							<br><br>
							<span class="ttitle">Sree Reddy - Co Founder</span>
							<br><br>
							Sree is a graudate of UC Berkeley , Haas School of Business, and prior to TraceCloud , he was managing the largest Requisite Pro installation in the world. 
							The experiences (Scars) he gained from that engagement , defined his thinking about <b><i>What Users REALLY want</i></b>. He is passionate about 
							<b><i>Making the system add value to the user</i></b>
